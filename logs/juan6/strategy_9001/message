Basic company information, product portfolio, R&D team, and marketing strategies.

2. Rules
Please keep in mind the following rules:
(1) Strategies:

    It is crucial to find the right approach for your company, as this is the first and most important aspect. Consider factors such as:

        Selling more products at a lower cost to attract a larger customer base.
        Catering to high-end clients with premium, cutting-edge technology.
        A hybrid approach balancing innovation and affordability.

(2) R&D Team:

    You are not allowed to communicate with or train the R&D team members.
    The skill level of an R&D team member is directly proportional to their salary.

(3) Products:

    The quality of a product is determined by two aspects:

        Cost-effectiveness (production cost vs. selling price ratio). The higher the value, the better the cost-effectiveness.
        The expertise of the R&D team.

(4) Marketing:

    The only available channel for advertising is the marketing module. If you wish to communicate with clients, you can only do so through this module.

Your first task is to analyze the above information, then write it down.
Your second task is to design or revise your strategy, then write it down.
Your third task is to create a general plan based on this strategy, then write it down.
