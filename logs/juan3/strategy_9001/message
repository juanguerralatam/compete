        Selling more products at a lower cost to attract a larger customer base.
        Catering to high-end clients with premium, cutting-edge technology.
        A hybrid approach balancing innovation and affordability.

    You are not allowed to communicate with or train the R&D team members.
    The skill level of an R&D team member is directly proportional to their salary.

(3) Products:

        Cost-effectiveness (production cost vs. selling price ratio). The higher the value, the better the cost-effectiveness.
        The expertise of the R&D team.

(4) Marketing:

    The only available channel for advertising is the marketing module. If you wish to communicate with clients, you can only do so through this module.
